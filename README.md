# Image-Captioner

### What is This?
It is a deep Neural network which uses CNNs and RNNs and MLPs for captioning images. It was done for SUT DL course.

### Dependencies
You can intall all the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Architecture

I used resnet152 as CNN encoder and LSTMs as RNN decoder. You can see a schematic of the model in the image below.
